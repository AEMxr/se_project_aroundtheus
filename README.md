**Intro**

Around The U.S. is project 3 through 9 of the software engineer online course from TripleTen. It displays a header, a profile section, cards for 6 scenic locations from The United States, and a footer. The project is focused on responsive design, accessibility, best practices for formatting, and deploying to github using gitbash. Project 4 and 5 illustrates the JavaScript functionality of the buttons and modal. Project 6 showcases the validation functionality of the modals. Projects 7 - 9 has yet to be implemented.

Using Figma, I followed the UI design and exported assets. The HTML and CSS were coded from scratch using flex display, margins, paddings, and box-sizing for layout and responsive design. Semantic HTML5 elements and accessibility best practices were followed according to BEM standards. CSS classes, ID's, and media queries were used.
